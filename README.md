### ✨ Motivation

> I believe one of the most effective ways to learn a new language is through reading. This app was originally built for my personal use to help with that process. It’s designed to make reading more interactive and educational by allowing you to highlight vocabulary, save words along with their meanings, and even attach images when needed to aid memorization.
>
> Since I enjoy reading light novels, the app currently supports four languages out of the box, making it easy to switch between them while reading and learning. While it was created for personal use, you're welcome to adapt or extend it to fit > your own learning journey.
